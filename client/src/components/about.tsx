              Hundreds of open-source projects or hackathon winning ideas with
              great potential end up being forgotten in Github repositories. We
              found Crowdy, a hackathon-winning project that has great potential
              to help people globally. Powered by Ainize, we published the next
              version of Crowdy with new features -- but there’s still plenty of
              room for improvement.

              pharmacies, banks, and restaurants based on your current location
              to help people avoid crowded places, minimizing COVID19 risks. The
